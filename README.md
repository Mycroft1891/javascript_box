# Javascript

> JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted or JIT compiled programming language
> with first-class functions. Most well-known as the scripting language for
> Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JS is a prototype-based,
> multi-paradigm, dynamic scripting language, supporting object-oriented,
> imperative, and declarative styles. -

## Why Javascript

Javascript is the most widely used programming language. It can be used to
enhance web pages in a browser environment, building servers, writing scripts
to automate system tasks as well game development and iOS/Android developement.
It has gone through a huge grow over the past years.

## My goals with Javascript

Javascript was one of the first languages I learned mainly as a way to add a
dynamic feel to websites. Javascript has grown exponantially since then and I
have also learned a lot more about this powerful language since then from node
to express, graphql and react. There so many more things I want to learn about
this language:

- React, Vue, Angular
- Graphql
- Express, Koa
- React Native
- Electron
- D3, three js, babylon, phaser
- Jest testing
