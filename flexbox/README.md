# Flexbox

> The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module (a W3C Candidate Recommendation as of
> October 2017) aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and
> distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown
> and/or dynamic (thus the word "flex").
> 
> The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to
> alter its items' width/height (and order) to best fill the available space
> (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A
> flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to
> prevent overflow.
> 
> Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the
> regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline which is
> horizontally-based). While those work well for pages, they lack flexibility
> (no pun intended) to support large or complex applications (especially when
> it comes to orientation changing, resizing, stretching, shrinking, etc.).

Flexbox is a powerful way to add responsive styles to a website. It allows for
quick styling with minimal CSS and is well suited for SPAs such as React to
inline styling within components. Some styled components such as material-ui
are already build on flexbox and require a good understanding of how flexbox
works in order to make use of its components.
