#Babylon JS

A collection of my personal babylon js projects.
All projects are started with the app.js which is a simple nodeJS server for static files. Each project is separated into its own view and each view imports the babylon.js files from the script folder. All the scenes are imported from the scenes folder (blender scenes):

index-one,
index-two,
etc.
