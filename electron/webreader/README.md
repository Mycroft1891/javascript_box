# Web Reader

This is an electron app which allows the user to add a web link which will be
stored inside the app so the user can access the website later just like a
bookmark.

The app uses a responsive design with CSS flexbox and extensive keyboard
support. It also has a custom menu bar with actions and keyboard shortcuts to
access them.
