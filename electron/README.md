# Electron

With that slogan electron has persuaded various companies to use this powerful
library to build their desktop applications. While it is easy to get started
with electron, in order to make apps look and feel truly native it requires a
great amount of detail and experience to polish the app. For that reason this
folder hosts various electron projects which allow me to play with the different
APIs and get a better grasp of the underlying concepts like the main process,
the renderer process, ipc communication, etc.

For a list of resources to learn electron in depth refer to the base of this
repository under the **Resource** section.
